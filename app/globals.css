 * Apply a soft, peaceful purple backdrop across the entire site.

  /*
   * Apply a soft gradient with white at the centre fading to light purples
   * towards the edges. This gives the page a peaceful, airy feel while
   * hinting at the primary colour palette. A gentle backdrop blur creates
   * depth and a glossy finish similar to frosted glass. Use a neutral
   * sans‑serif stack for a clean, modern aesthetic.  
   */
  /*
   * Use a soft pastel gradient inspired by the reference design.  The colours
   * transition from a pale pink at the top through lavender into a light
   * periwinkle blue towards the bottom.  This multi‑stop gradient creates a
   * calming backdrop reminiscent of sunrise or dawn skies without drawing
   * attention away from the page content.  The central white tint lightens
   * the middle of the page to subtly focus attention on the hero section.

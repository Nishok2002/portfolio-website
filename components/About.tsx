      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        I’m a data analyst and machine learning practitioner with a passion for
        transforming raw information into clear, concise and actionable
        insights. With experience across multiple industries, I have helped
        organizations make better decisions by building dashboards,
        automating pipelines and developing predictive models.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        My toolkit includes Python, SQL, R, Neo4j, Snowflake, Tableau and
        Power\u00a0BI, along with a strong foundation in statistics and
        machine\u00a0learning. I thrive when collaborating with cross‑functional
        teams and enjoy communicating complex ideas through intuitive
        visualizations. Whether it’s cleaning messy datasets, modeling
        relationships or designing a new analytics solution, I’m always eager
        to learn and solve problems.
